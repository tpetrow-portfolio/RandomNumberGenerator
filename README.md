# Random Number Generator (C# WPF App)

This is a simple **Random Number Generator** application built with **C#** and **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**, designed to practice and showcase the integration of these technologies. The app takes a user-defined range of numbers as input and generates a random number within that range upon pressing a button.

### Features
- Accepts a **minimum** and **maximum** value as input from the user.
- Generates a random number between the input range when the "Generate" button is clicked.
- Displays the randomly generated number on the UI.

### Technologies Used
- **C#**: Programming language used to write the application logic.
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**: Used for creating the user interface.
- **XAML**: Used for defining the structure of the UI components.

### Purpose
This project was developed as a **practice exercise** to get hands-on experience with C#, XAML, and WPF integration.
